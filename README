Overview:

In this code users will be able to call the program called scopy which the purpose of this program to let users to copy 
another userâ€™s files according to some access configuration other than UNIX file permissions. The users names will be 
mantioned in the access control file like "file.txt.acl" the program will check for the user name and base on the .acl users names 
it will let them to copy the file or not. The program will set its SetUID bit so that scopy will
run as them. Other users may then run that instance of scopy, specifying a file they would like to retrieve.

How the other users then the main user will do to copy ther file to them 
"For example, assume Alice wants to make her schedule available to Bob. She places a copy of scopy
in her public directory at /home/alice/public/scopy, verifies that Bob will be able to access it, and sets
its SetUID bit with chmod u+s scopy. She also creates appropriate permission data so Bob can access her
daily schedule.txt. When Bob wants to make a copy, he runs a command like the following:
bob@wopr $ /home/alice/public/scopy /home/alice/daily_schedule.txt alices_schedule.txt"

This program has a Makefile if you need to run it you just call ***"make"**** to compile the scopy
and ******"make clean"****** if you need to move the object files.

This progam it include a file.txt.acl , file.txt , Makefile, and the main cod3e in scopy.c //////
